# From Annotation to Features

- This folder contains the scripts (and a python notebook with the commented scripts) 
that can be used to transform the data we collected and the annotations to features.

- A brief description of the scripts:

    - `1_average_interval.py` gets the average and median time between tweets for all the users.
    
    - `2_annotated_graph.py`
